# -Towers-of-Hanoi
The problem: You are given three towers a, b, and c. We start with n rings on tower a and we need to transfer them to tower b subject to the following restrictions: 1. We can only move one ring at a time, and 2. We may never put a larger numbered ring on top of a smaller numbered one. There are always 3 towers. Your program will prompt the user for the number of rings.
